# Matrix-Visualization-in-MATLAB
 This MATLAB project visualizes matrix data using heatmaps, surface plots, and contour plots. Users input a matrix and select a plot type to visualize matrix values. The project provides clear 2D and 3D visualizations, helping to better understand and interpret the matrix data.
